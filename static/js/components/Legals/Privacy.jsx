				<strong>Improving and customizing the Platform and advertising:</strong>

				<ul>
					<li>To analyze your use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order to improve MASAS - "Make A Sound And Share" and customize it to your needs and interests.</li>
					<li>To show you interesting MASAS ads, when you visit third party websites. When you see our ads on a third party website or apps, we or third party services we engage for this purpose, may collect information your browser or mobile app makes available when seeing the ad (e.g. ip-addresses, referral URL, browser details, timestamp of request). Third party websites or apps may also allow us to measure the success of our ads on their websites. This may include e.g. whether a click converted to an actual purchase of a Subscription. Please see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may be collected and how to opt-out.</li>
					<li>To show you ads on behalf of advertisers, we use information that you make available to us when you interact with the Platform (e.g. by listening, liking andcreating playlists, by clicking on posts on your feed), including location data, together with information you provide to us through the Platform, e.g. demographic information, you make available to us (such as your age or gender) directly or through third party services as well as information your browser sends us when using the Platform (e.g. referral URLs, device type or location data). This allows us to show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you. Please note that we do not share personal data with advertisers. Instead, advertisers pre-define a specific audience by certain generic criteria (e.g. the city of residence, the age range, number of followers or number of people following) for a specific ad campaign. If your profile matches these generic criteria, we may choose to display suitable ads to you. We may also display ads based on the content that you have recently viewed or searched.</li>
					<li>Before we may use location data from the app for the first time, your mobile device will generally ask you for permission first. In case you gave permission to do so, location based services in your device will collect location data for a couple of seconds. These will then be shared with us or a respective service provider. When we engage third party services such as ad-networks that enable us showing you interest based ads, we may also allow them to collect certain information such as cookie data from you. This information would allow these third-parties to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</li>
					<li>If you allow third party websites to collect and share data when you interact with their platform, ad-networks may use that information together with the information we allow them to collect on the Platform. Please see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may be collected and how to opt-out.</li>
					<li>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may send to you from time to time.</li>
					<li>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the proposed use of your personal data.</li>

				<h2>Cookies and similar technology</h2>


				<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the Platform (the Website and the Apps and Services) that we provide.</p> 

				<p>We have included information about our use of cookies and similar technology in a separate document (in our Legals section) called "Cookie Policy" that forms part of this Privacy Policy.

These may and as far as allowed by your settings or your device, use information about your visit and interaction with the Platform in order to show you personalized ads of products and services that may be of interest to you. Personal information such as your name or email address will not be shared with these.</p>

				<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar technology in our Cookie Policy document (inside our Legals tab).</p> 

				<p>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other technologies as described in our Cookies Policy, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal data that we collect using these technologies.</p>



				<h2>Choice and control</h2>


				<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of information you provide to us, and the control you have over that information.</p>

				<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any personal data in order to visit the Website, although certain information will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a MASAS account, you can control your information in the following ways.
				
				<h3>Email and notification preferences</h3>

				When you are signed into your account, you can access your Settings by hovering your profile picture (top right corner on Desktop) or by expanding the main menu (top left corner on Mobile). In your Settings, you will have the option to: "Terminate Your Account", "receive email notifications", "Receive Newsletter - via e-mail".</p>

				<h3>Sharing with other apps and networks</h3>

				<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications before sharing your information with, or connecting your MASAS account to, any of these third party sites or applications.</p>

				<h3>Sharing with app developers</h3>

				<p>MASAS will have an open API at some point in the future, which will allow third party developers to build some really exciting apps as an extension of the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you will be able to disable API access for your sounds within your Settings page. Please note that disabling API access for your sounds will also disable your Public Profile from beings in the API. </p>

				<h3>Customizing the Platform and personalized ads</h3>

				<p>We may also use third party services using cookies or similar technologies showing you personalized ads on our behalf. Please see our Cookies Policy for how to opt-out of those.
				Please be aware that even if you opt out of interest-based ads, you may still see ads, which likely not be appealing to your interests.</p>

				<h3>Cookies</h3>

				<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy.</p> 
				<p>Further information is available athttp://aboutcookies.org.</p>

				<h3>App preferences</h3>
				
				<p>You can use the settings within your iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the MASAS tab. With an Android device you need to open the MASAS app and open the basic settings tab within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting information being sent from the app.</p> 
				<p>Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>

				<h3>Deleting your account</h3>

				<p>You can delete your account in your Settings by hovering your profile picture (top right corner on Desktop website) or by expanding the main menu (top left corner on Mobile website). In your Settings, you will have the option to: "Terminate Your Account". Please bear in mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable.</p>
				<p>You are therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
				<p>Even if you delete your MASAS account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search engines' caching processes are outside of MASAS' control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
				<p>Please note that deleting any MASAS Apps, or any third party apps to which your MASAS account is connected, will not delete your MASAS account.</p>
				<p> If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Settings tab in your main menu on the Website or the Apps. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your MASAS account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third party app.</p>
